## Implement the data link layer framing methods such as character counting, character-stuffing and bit stuffing.

Framing breaks the datagrams passed down by above layers and convert them into frames ready for transfer.
1. Character Counting

  - Procedure  
    - The the data that needs to be transmitted is taken as the input.
    - The length of each frame is calculated and attached before the frame.
    - After the data reaches the receiver, the lengths are removed and data is printed frame-wise.
